# Starting coding without needing to install anything

In a lot of cases you can try working in a language (or with a technology) without committing the time to setting up tools on a computer (a process even very experience developers can find both time consuming and frustrating)

## 'Try' tools
These allow you to play around with technologies and languages. You are generally limited in how far you can go but are useful for seeing how a language or technology feels - especially if you have limited time.
